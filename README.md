# Basic_Python_course
A complete Jupyter Notebook covering Python basics â€” variables, data types, loops, functions, OOP, file handling, and advanced topics like lambda, map/filter, and exceptions. Created as part of my AI &amp; ML journey at MIT-AOE to build a strong foundation for data science, ML, and GenAI. ðŸš€
